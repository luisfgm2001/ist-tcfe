\subsection{Operating point, $t<0s$} \label{subsec:op}

In addition to theoretical analysis, we computed the characteristics of the circuit for $t<0s$ using Ngspice.

Taking into account that the voltage source $V_d$ is controlled by the current $I_d$, which flows through resistor $R_6$, and Ngspice requires a voltage source with current $I_d$ to implement this component, we considered an additional voltage source of $0V$ in series with the resistor $R_6$, working as an amperemeter measuring the aforementioned current (Figure~\ref{fig:node8}). That's the reason an additional node (ex) appears in Table~\ref{tab:op11}.

\end{figure}

The simulated operating point results for $t<0s$ are then shown in Table~\ref{tab:op11}.

Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one notices that the results are significantly similar and only differ in digits with small order of magnitude.

\subsection{Operating Point, $v_s(t)=0$} \label{subsec:op2}

In this subsection, we simulate the operating point for $v_s(t)=0$, i.e., with the voltage source $v_s$ turned off, and a voltage source $V_x=V(6)-V(8)$ in the capacitor's place, just like in Subsection~\ref{subsec:eqresist}. This procedure was performed in order to determine the initial conditions for the natural response of the circuit. The simulated operating point results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:op21}.

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\linewidth}

\vspace{24mm}

  \label{tab:op22}
\end{table}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{3mm}

Comparing the results from both analyses, we see that the nodes with null voltages determined resorting to nodal method have also voltages very close to zero in Ngspice, with order of magnitude $10^{-15}$ or smaller. The only nonzero voltage, $V_6$, has approximately the same value in the simulation and in the theoretical analysis. Therefore, we can conclude that the time constant of the simulation will match the one computed with Octave and that the initial conditions of the natural solution are pratically the same.

\subsection{Transient Analysis - Natural Response} \label{subsec:trannat}

Considering the values of $V(6)$ and $V(8)$, determined in Subsection~\ref{subsec:op2}, as initial conditions, we simulated the natural response of the circuit using Ngspice's transient analysis mode. The plot for the time interval $[0,20]$ms is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:trannat}.

\vspace{-10mm}

\begin{figure}[H] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{../sim/trans3.pdf}
\caption{Natural solution, $v_{6n}(t)$, (expressed in Volt) in the interval $[0,20]$ms, determined using Ngspice.}
\label{fig:trannat}
\end{figure}

Comparing the plot in Figure~\ref{fig:trannat} with the one in Figure~\ref{fig:natsol}, we can see that they match exactly, as they intersect the $y$ axis in the same point and the decayment is very similar.

\subsection{Transient Analysis - Final Solution} \label{subsec:tranfin}

Just like in the previous subsection, we used Ngspice's transient analysis mode to compute the response of the circuit, now with the voltage source turned on and frequency $f=1$kHz. The plot of the response on node 6 and of the stimulus are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trans4}.

\vspace{-10mm}

\begin{figure}[H] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{../sim/trans4.pdf}
\caption{Response on node 6, $v_{6}(t)$ (red), and stimulus (blue) (expressed in Volt) in the interval $[0,20]$ms, determined using Ngspice.}
\label{fig:trans4}
\end{figure}

Comparing these results with the theoretical ones, obtained with Octave and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:finsol}, we see that they match in their common interval of time, $[0,20]$ms, since the response on node 6 intersects the $y$ axis in the same value in both cases and the decayment is similar, just like in the natural solution. Moreover, in both plots, the response on node 6 seems to be in phase opposition with the stimulus and the magnitude is similar in the final period of time. Therefore, we can also conclude that the phase and magnitude of the forced signal obtained using Ngspice are in accordance with the ones computed theoretically.

\subsection{Frequency Analysis} \label{subsec:freqanalysis}

Finally, we analysed the response on node 6 and on the capacitor for different frequencies in the interval $0.1$Hz to $1$MHz. The results for the magnitude and phase responses are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:simmag} and \ref{fig:simphase}, respectively.

\begin{figure}[H] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{../sim/ac5mag.pdf}
\caption{Magnitude response of $v_6(t)$(blue), $v_s(t)$(red) and $v_c(t)$(yellow) (expressed in decibels), computed with Ngspice.}
\label{fig:simmag}
\end{figure}

Once again, we verify that the magnitude of both voltages in node 6 and in the capacitor are approximately constant and superior to the magnitude of the stimulus for low frequencies. In the first case, the voltage decreases until stabilizing on another value, lower than the magnitude of the voltage source, and remains constant for high frequencies. On the other hand, the voltage of the capacitor decreases linearly for higher frequencies (in decibels), meaning that, in Volts, it tends to zero when the frequency increases.

\begin{figure}[H] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{../sim/ac5phase.pdf}
\caption{Phase response of $v_6(t)$(blue), $v_s(t)$(red) and $v_c(t)$(yellow) (expressed in degrees), computed with Ngspice.}
\label{fig:simphase}
\end{figure}

In terms of the phases analysis, we see that, for low frequencies, both signals are in phase with the voltage source and, as the frequency increases, they vary and eventually stabilize for high frequencies. Additionally, one notices that the voltage in node 6 is in phase opposition with the stimulus and the voltage in the capacitor has a phase delay of $-90^{\circ}$ with respect to the stimulus.

One can see clearly that these descriptions match the ones previously portrayed in the theoretical analysis, but we can also check graphically that the responses are very similar to the ones computed with Octave.
