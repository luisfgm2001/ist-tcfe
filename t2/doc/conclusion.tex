\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a RC circuit has been achieved. We were able to successfully determine the characteristics of the circuit and its responses to the alternate voltage source through theoretical and simulation analysis. The simulation results, obtained with Ngspice, matched precisely the ones obtained theoretically, resorting to Octave, in all of the performed analysis. This can be explained by the fact that this is a simple circuit containing only linear components.
