\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing an electric circuit has been achieved. We were able to determine successfully the characteristics of the circuit and its responses to the alternate voltage source through theoretical and simulation analysis. The simulation results obtained with Ngspice matched the ones obtained with Octave precisely in all of the performed analysis. This can be explained by the fact that this is a simple circuit containing only linear components.
