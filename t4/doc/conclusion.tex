\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of designing an AC/DC converter has been achieved. The outputs of the envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits obtained by simulation, using Ngspice, were extremely similar to the ones obtained theoretically, resorting to Octave. Considering the also satisfactory values of the average of $v_o$ and the ripple, we managed to get a merit $M$ of $40.72$, a result that expresses the good efficiency of the designed circuit.
