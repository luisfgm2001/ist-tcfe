\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Considering the results obtained, we're able to affirm that the objective of the laboratory assignment has been accomplished. As desired, the merit turned to be quite satisfactory, although a higher merit could be accomplished, weren't it for the deformation of the output sine wave.\\

The high efficiency of our audio amplifier is also evidenced in the cut off frequencies, which include the interval of frequencies possible for human beings to hear.\\

Nevertheless, despite our efforts to get the simulated quantities as close to the theoretical ones as possible, the non-linearity of the circuit components, chiefly the transistors, made it impossible to do so. In other words, the approximations made in the theoretical analysis couldn't produce the same results as the complex model used by Ngspice.\\

In summation, this task was completed successfully, as we made it feasible to amplify an input voltage in a great range of frequencies and without any visible distortion in the output signal.
