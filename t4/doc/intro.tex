\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to design an Audio Amplifier, which converts a signal of alternating current of $230V$ and frequency of $50 Hz$ to direct current of $12V$. In order to achieve this goal, we made use of a transformer to lower the voltage to $0.70609$ of the input voltage. In addition, we had at our disposal resistors, capacitors, and NPN and PNP transistors, whose costs are presented in Table~\ref{tab:costs}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }\label{tab:costs}
Component & Cost \\
\hline
Resistors & $1$ MU/k$\Omega$ \\  
Capacitors & $1$ MU/$\mu$ F \\
Transistors & $0.1$ MU/transistor    
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}[]{Cost of the components of the circuit.}
\end{center}

The following quantity, merit $M$, is defined with the purpose of evaluating the quality of the audio amplifier:

\begin{equation}
  M = \frac{voltageGain \times bandwidth}{cost \times lowerCutoffFreq}
\end{equation}

Thus, the higher the value of the function, the better its quality.\\

With this in mind, we built the circuit illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:amplifier}, with a resistor with resistance $R = 369.982$ $k\Omega$, a capacitor with capacitance $C = 420$ $\mu F$ and $4+19$ regular diodes.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we present a theoretical analysis of the audio amplifier, where we develop a model able to predict the output of the envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits and compute the output DC level and the voltage ripple. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, we write a Ngspice script to simulate the AC/DC converter and to measure the aforementioned quantities. Additionally, we compare the results from Section~\ref{sec:analysis} to the ones obtained by simulation. Furthermore, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, we summarise the results of the simulations and their agreement with the theoretical predictions. Finally, we present the merit $M$ of the designed amplifier.
