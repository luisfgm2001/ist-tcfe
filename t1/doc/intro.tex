% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing eight nodes numbered from 1 to 7, plus GND. In the present circuit, we can find seven resistors, $R_1$ to $R_7$, one voltage source, $V_a$, one current source, $I_d$, one voltage controlled current source, $I_b$ and, finally, one current controlled voltage source, $V_c$, connected as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:t1}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we present a theoretical analysis of the circuit using the mesh method, as well as the nodal method and, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, we compare these results to the ones obtained by simulation using Ngspice. Furthermore, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, we summarise the results of the simulations and their agreement with the theoretical predictions.
