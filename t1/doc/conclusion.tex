\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing an electric circuit has been achieved. Its characteristics were determined theoretically, resorting to mesh and nodal methods and using the Octave maths tool, as well as simulated using Ngspice.
The simulation results matched the theoretical ones precisely, which can be explained by the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components.
