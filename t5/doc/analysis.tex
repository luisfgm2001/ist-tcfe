\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In order to analyse theoretically the circuit illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:amplifier}, we considered that the OP-AMP is ideal and therefore, its input impedance is infinite and its output impedance is zero. Keeping this in mind, we were able to derive that the input and output impedances of the circuit are:

\begin{equation}
Z_{in}=R_1+\frac{1}{j\omega C_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Z_{out}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{j\omega}{\frac{1}{C_2}+\frac{1}{C_3}}}
\end{equation}

Where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the input signal.

We were also able to derive the following transfer function:

\begin{equation}
T_f(\omega)=\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}=\frac{j\omega R_1 C_1}{1+j\omega R_1 C_1}\times(1+\frac{R_3+R_5}{R_4})\times \frac{1}{1+j\omega R_2 C_2}
\end{equation}

With this transfer function, we obtained the value of the frequency response, $v_{out}(f)/v_{in}(f)$. The plot of the gain and the phase in terms of the frequency of the input signal are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:gainteo} and~\ref{fig:phaseteo}.

In order to compute the central frequency, we determined the low and high cutoff frequencies, $f_l$ and $f_h$ respectively. Hence, the central frequency, $f_c$, can be given by:

\begin{equation}
f_c=\sqrt(f_l\times f_h)
\end{equation}

Finally, we calculated the voltage the gain, the input and output impedances at the central frequency.

The results of the theoretical analysis are presented in Table~\ref{tab:resultsteo}:
