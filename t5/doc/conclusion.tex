\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Considering the results obtained, we’re able to affirm that we managed the components at our disposal as efficiently as possible. Running several simulations, the circuit we presented was the one that produced the highest merit.\\

The success of our circuit is evidenced in the satisfactory values of our central frequency deviation. Although the gain deviation is not as small, we weren’t able to improve it without increasing the central frequency deviation.\\

In general, the results obtained in the theoretical and simulation analysis were pretty similar, albeit the phase plot of the frequency response differs significantly between both methods, by consequence of the simplicity of the model used in Octave, that, in great part, contrasts with the complexity of the Ngspice methods - clearly closer to a real model.\\

Nevertheless, in a broader view, we accomplished the goal of this laboratory assignment as we successfully implemented a BandPass Filter using an Operational Amplifier.
